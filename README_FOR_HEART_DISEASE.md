# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters. It aims to support early detection using clinical data and supervised learning techniques.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) and includes 14 medical attributes that are known risk factors for heart disease.

## üéØ Objective

To develop a classification model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient health indicators.

## üß™ Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Imported the dataset using `pandas` and explored data shape, types, and structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized values where needed.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized distributions of features
   - Correlation heatmaps to identify feature importance
   - Pair plots and histograms
4. **Model Building**:
   - Trained multiple classifiers:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine
   - Used train-test split and cross-validation
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC curves

## üìà Results

- Achieved up to **90%+ accuracy** with the best-performing model.
- Random Forest and SVM yielded the highest scores in terms of both precision and recall.
- ROC-AUC curve analysis showed good model generalization.
