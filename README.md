# üõçÔ∏è Black Friday Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **Black Friday Dataset** from a retail store, aiming to understand customer purchasing behavior and gain insights from the data. The dataset is commonly used for data preprocessing and analysis exercises.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Black Friday Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sdolezel/black-friday) and contains customer demographics, product categories, and purchase amounts from a retail store on Black Friday.

## üîç Objectives

- Understand the structure of the dataset
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Handle missing values
- Visualize data distributions and relationships
- Analyze customer and product trends

## üß™ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading & Inspection
- Loaded dataset using `pandas`
- Examined shape, datatypes, and sample entries

### 2. Missing Values
- Identified missing values in `Product_Category_2` and `Product_Category_3`
- Filled missing values with mode or kept as-is depending on analysis goals

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Removed irrelevant features (`User_ID`, `Product_ID`) if necessary for group-wise analysis
- Converted categorical features into proper formats

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate analysis: Distribution plots for gender, age, city category, purchase, etc.
- Bivariate analysis: Relationship between purchase amount and other features
- Aggregated insights using `groupby` and `pivot_table`

### 5. Visualizations
- Bar plots for gender vs purchase
- Histograms for numerical fields
- Count plots for categorical features
- Box plots to detect outliers in `Purchase`

## üìà Key Insights

- Males make more purchases than females
- Age group 26‚Äì35 forms the majority of buyers
- City Category B has the highest sales
- Product Category 1 dominates purchase behavior
- Significant number of missing values in secondary and tertiary product categories
